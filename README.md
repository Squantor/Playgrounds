# Playground
This is a general collection of programming small examples, trying things out, proof of concepts and many other junky, hacky, crappy things. Dont use the commit log of this repository to check how good of a programmer I am ;-).
## platforms
Most of the stuff either runs in linux on PC or some microcontroller, usually LPC.
